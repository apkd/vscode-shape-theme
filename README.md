# Shape #

A minimalistic theme designed with the goal of increased readability and minimal visual clutter.

Inspired by the [NightOwl2](https://studiostyl.es/schemes/nightowl2) theme (my all time VS2015 favorite) with editor colors borrowed from [Monokai One Dark Vivid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ashpowell.monokai-one-dark-vivid) (also definitely check it out).
